# Bouncy-bounce
Just a small, fun website made using vanilla html/css, javascript and JQuery(a little)

I was just really, <i>really</i> bored during the quarantine, so I decided to do a small project. 
It's not pretty, and some of the code is in french, while most of it is in english... I dunno if anyone will ever do anything with it, but if you want to, knock yourself out!
